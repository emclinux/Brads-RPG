Version 0.0.4

An inventory is now added to the game.  You can access the inventory by pressing the 'i' key and then choosing the item that you wish to use.  You can also pickup items left in the rooms by pressing the 'g' key.  Right now all that is added is a healing potion but much more later.

Also more monsters and rooms because you have the ability to heal.

Version 0.0.2

The player and monsters now have the ability to dodge.  Dodge is a special ability called Reaction.  
A reaction ability will be % based ability and you or the monster will do this without thought.

Currently the dodge % is hard coded into the fight but will be determined later by your speed.  The 
speed of player/monster will determine the base dodge % and can have an effect of the % to hit or % 
to dodge of the opposite.  For example the level 1 player attacks a level 5 orc.  The player 
(because of the slower speed) will almost always miss the Orc and the Orc will almost always hit
the player.
